# DNS-Based Licensing with minidns library example

There are various approaches to querying a DNS TXT record, which is commonly used to obtain information such as verification data or license details. One effective method is utilizing MiniDNS, a lightweight DNS client library. When you send a DNS TXT query using MiniDNS, it communicates with the DNS server and retrieves a response that includes the requested license data. 

MiniDNS is versatile and not only supports desktop environments but is also compatible with Android devices. This makes it a valuable tool for developers creating Android applications that require DNS queries for functionalities such as domain verification or service authentication. With its ease of use and reliable performance, MiniDNS is an excellent choice for integrating DNS TXT record querying into various applications.
